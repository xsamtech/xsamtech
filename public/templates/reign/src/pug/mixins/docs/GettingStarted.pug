	h5.pt-5.mt-n5(data-anchor) Quick start
	p Looking to start your project quickly? Just unzip the
		code  #{version}.zip
		| . We have precompiled and packaged everything in the
		code  public
		|  directory for you. Start editing the 
		code pages/starter.html
		|  with a text or code editor, save it, and open the file in your favourite browser to see the changes.
		
	h5.pt-3(data-anchor) Setting up Build system
	p Unzip the 
		code  #{version}.zip
		| to any folder and open a command line or terminal at that location.
		| Sparrow's dev tools require 
		a(href='https://nodejs.org/en/' target='_blank')  Node
		|  and 
		a(href='https://git-scm.com/' target='_blank') Git
		|  . If you do not have them in your machine, please install their latest stable version from their corresponding website. As you have 
		span.fw-black.text-black Node and Git installed and accessible from your terminal or command line
		| , install 
		a(href="https://gulpjs.com/" target='_blank') Gulp CLI
		|  package 
		|  globally with the following command:
	pre
		code.lang-html.
			npm i gulp-cli -g
	
	p.mt-4 When you’re done, install the rest of the sparrow’s dependencies with:
	pre
		code.lang-html.
			npm i
	
	p.mt-4 Now run:
	pre
		code.lang-html.
			gulp
	
	p.mt-4 Running gulp will compile the SCSS, transpile the javascript, copy all required libraries form 
		code node_modules
		|  to the corresponding 
		code public/assets/vendors 
		|  directory and will open a browser window to 
		code public/index.html
	p All of the following folders are monitored for changes, which will tell the browser to reload automatically after any changes are made:
	+ComponentCard
		| public/assets/video/
		| public/assets/img/
		| public/vendors
		| src/pug/
		| src/scss/ 
		| src/js/
	
	p.mt-4 Now you can edit any 
		code pug
		|  file from 
		code src/pug
		| , change SCSS variable with 
		code scss/_user-variables.scss
		| , or write your own SCSS code in 
		code scss/_user.scss
		|  and add or update 
		code javaScript
		|  from 
		code src/js
		|  directory.

	.alert.alert-warning Running the 
		code gulp
		|  command will discard and regenerate all the files in following directories:
	+ComponentCardLib
		|  public/**/*.html
		|  public/assets/css/
		|  public/assets/js/
		|  public/vendors

	p.mt-4 Hit 
		code Ctrl+C
		|  or just close the command line window to stop the server.

	p Happy editing!
